# live_comments
implementation of comments


send.php - saves data to mysql database
get.php - reads comments from mysql database

index.php contains most of the logic. JQuery with PHP allows user to post and read comments from MySQL database without refreshing webpage, but I have also used some HTML and CSS for basic forms etc.
